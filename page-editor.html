                Here, making each day of the year. Changing my life with the wave of her hand, nobody can, deny that theres something there. There, running my hands through her hair. Both of us thinking how good it can be, someone is speaking, and she doesn't know he's there.
                I want here Everywhere, and if she's beside me I know I need never care. But to love her is to need her Everywhere.
                Knowing that love is to care, both of us thinking how good it can be, someone is speaking, and she doese't know he's there.
